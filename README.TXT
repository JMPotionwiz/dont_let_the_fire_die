If you launch the game with the command prompt, the first arguement (if any) will be used as the world's name.
Other arguements will be ignored. If no arguements where passed (or the game wasn't launched using command
prompt), the world name will default to "world"

Worlds are saved and loaded as "<name of world>.wrld"


  GAMEPLAY

When starting a new game, you will be set within a clearing surrounding a campfire. This is the only campfire in
the entire world, and it is necessary for your survival. It will die if you don't feed it enough fuel.

If you're lucky, you may have enough twigs and stones nearby to get started. If not, you may have to venture into
the dark.

Trees can be chopped down with an axe. You can also try using your bare hands, but it will take MUCH longer.

The campfire can be used to slowly convert logs into charcoal, and cook food. It can also be used to destroy
items.

Torches allow you to venture further from the campfire, to collect resources and explore. Unfortunately, there is
nothing to explore, except a large, empty forest. Torches are lit using the campfire, but will burn out after a
bit. Lit torches can also be used to relight the campfire.

Torches still produce light when on the ground.

Spears can be thrown.

Don't stay in the dark for to long. You don't know what might be out there!

Remember to eat, as you can starve to death. Alas, there aren't any vegetarian options yet, so you will have to
hunt for your food.

In case you were wondering what happened to the inventory: there is none. You don't have any pockets (magic or
otherwise), and can only take with you that which your hands can carry! You can keep a single tool on your belt.

Occasionally, monsters may come to destroy you and your campfire.

Try to survive as long as possible (or until you get bored, lol).
